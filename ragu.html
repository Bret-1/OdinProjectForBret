<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Ground meat</li>
    <li>Tomato paste</li>
    <li>Tomato sauce</li>
    <li>Onion, carrot and celary</li>
    <li>Garlic</li>
    <li>Olive oil</li>
    <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>Milk and chicken stock</li>
    <li>Herbs</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Start by getting a tall pot very hot, and adding some olive oil followed by the ground meat. Using a wooden spoon,<br>
    break apart the meat. After a couple minutes, add the onion, carrot and celary. Scrape the bottom of the pan as these <br>
    release moisture. When softened, add the garlic followed by the tomato paste after a minute. Saute for another minute <br>
    then add the tomato sauce, herbs, milk and stock. Bring to a simmer and cook uncovered for 2 hours. <br>
